Scenario 10 – Reconnaissance-Level Network Exposure Assessment Using Nmap

You are assigned as a network security assessor to evaluate possible unnecessary exposure of internal services. There is no evidence of compromise, and management has strictly authorized only observational reconnaissance, not exploitation or disruption. Nmap is used purely to support security policy decisions.

Q1. Why Nmap-based scanning, even without exploitation, is a powerful security decision-support activity rather than an attack

Nmap scanning, when used without exploitation, is a visibility and assessment activity, not an attack. It helps security teams understand what services are exposed, where they are exposed, and how broadly.

This information supports decision-making by:

Revealing the organization’s attack surface

Identifying unnecessary or forgotten services

Highlighting deviations from security policy

No payloads, exploits, or service interruptions are involved. Instead of causing harm, Nmap provides situational awareness, which is essential for risk management, governance, and compliance. Therefore, it functions as a preventive security tool, not an offensive one.

Q2. Using Nmap results, how to logically differentiate between essential services and policy violations without knowing business context

Even without business context, Nmap results can be logically evaluated using security best-practice assumptions.

Services that are:

Common and expected (e.g., HTTPS, DNS)

Limited to a small number of hosts

Consistently configured across systems

can be considered potentially essential.

Services that:

Appear on many systems unnecessarily

Run on uncommon or legacy ports

Are inconsistent with host roles

Use insecure or deprecated protocols

can be flagged as policy violations or review candidates.

This approach does not assume malicious intent; it simply identifies excess exposure that violates the principle of least privilege and minimal service exposure.

Q3. Why multiple open ports across several hosts represent a risk condition

Multiple open ports across many hosts indicate a large attack surface, even if no active attack is detected.

Each open port:

Represents a running service

Increases the chance of misconfiguration

May become vulnerable in the future due to missing patches

Attackers typically begin with reconnaissance. A network exposing many services gives attackers more opportunities to exploit weaknesses later. Therefore, this finding represents a latent or potential risk, not a breach, but one that weakens the organization’s security posture.

Q4. How service version detection influences patch management and risk prioritization without confirming vulnerability

Service version detection identifies what software and versions are running, not whether they are exploitable.

This information helps by:

Identifying outdated or end-of-life software

Supporting patch prioritization decisions

Aligning systems with vendor support lifecycles

Highlighting systems that require early review

Rather than confirming a vulnerability, version detection enables proactive risk assessment, allowing security teams to prioritize updates and reduce exposure before issues arise.




Scenario: 11

Scenario 11 – iptables Rules to Harden Network Access
Assumptions

Trusted admin network: 192.168.10.0/24

SSH port: 22

HTTP port: 80

HTTPS port: 443

Step 1: Flush existing rules
iptables -F
iptables -X

Step 2: Set default policies
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

Step 3: Allow loopback interface
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

Step 4: Allow established connections
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

Step 5: Allow SSH only from trusted network
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.10.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

Step 6: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from all users
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

Step 7: Block all other unsolicited inbound traffic

Already handled by default DROP policy.

Optional: Save rules permanently
Debian/Ubuntu
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

RHEL/CentOS
service iptables save

Security Justification

SSH is restricted to trusted admin network → prevents unauthorized remote login

HTTP/HTTPS is public → allows web application access

Default DROP → minimizes exposure, blocks all other unsolicited traffic

Stateful filtering ensures existing connections continue smoothly


Senerio 13:

Scenario 13 – Linux Firewall Configuration for SSH Only

A Linux computer is connected to a network. The admin wants to allow only SSH access, block all other incoming connections, and allow normal outgoing connections. This can be achieved using iptables.

Q1. Why is a firewall needed on a Linux system?

A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on defined security rules.

Protects the system from unauthorized access

Prevents attacks on exposed services

Reduces the system’s attack surface

Ensures network policies are enforced

Q2. Default policy for incoming traffic

To make the system secure, the default policy for incoming traffic should be DROP.

This blocks all unsolicited incoming connections.

Only explicitly allowed services (like SSH) can connect.

Q3. Rule to allow SSH (port 22) access
Step 1: Flush existing rules
iptables -F
iptables -X

Step 2: Set default policies
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

Step 3: Allow loopback interface
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

Step 4: Allow established/related connections
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

Step 5: Allow SSH (port 22)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT


Only SSH connections from any host are allowed.

All other unsolicited connections are blocked by default policy.

Q4. Why should established connections be allowed?

Ensures ongoing sessions (like SSH, HTTP requests initiated by the system) are not interrupted.

Allows replies to outgoing connections to return successfully.

Without this rule, even legitimate responses to initiated connections could be dropped.

Q5. What happens if all incoming traffic is allowed?

System becomes fully exposed to the network.

Unauthorized users could access any service.

Increases the risk of malware infection, data theft, or system compromise.

Breaks the principle of least privilege and makes the firewall ineffective.

Summary of iptables Setup (SSH-Only Firewall)
iptables -F
iptables -X
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT


✅ Firewall allows only SSH, blocks all other incoming traffic, allows normal outgoing traffic.
